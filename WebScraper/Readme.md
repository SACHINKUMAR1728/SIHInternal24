# Script to Extract Data for Indian Commercial laws

## PDF to Context, Question, Answer framed using Gemini API

This script takes a PDF file, processes its content into smaller chunks, and generates question-answer pairs using the Gemini API. In addition to generating QnA, it also creates relevant contexts for each answer and rewrites the answers to be clearer and more concise. The results are saved into a CSV file, making it ideal for generating training data for machine learning models. 

## Output Format

The script processes the PDF content into smaller chunks and generates the following four fields for each chunk. These are saved in the output CSV file in the following columns:

| Column Name          | Description                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Question**          | A question generated by the Gemini API based on the text chunk from the PDF.                  |
| **Answer**            | A concise and clear answer generated by the Gemini API in response to the question.           |
| **Context**           | A relevant context for the generated answer, designed to help train a model.                  |
| **Rewritten Answer**  | A refined and clearer version of the generated answer, rewritten by the Gemini API.           |



## Indian Commercial Court Judgment Data Scraper From CSV URL

The extracted data is then saved into a CSV file, making it suitable for further legal research or training machine learning models.

### Output Format

The script processes the scraped judgment data and saves the extracted information into a CSV file with the following columns:

| Column Name        | Description                                                                          |
